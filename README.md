# 👋 Hi there, I'm Lubbin

Welcome to my GitHub — a curated collection of things I’ve built, broken, fixed, and occasionally obsessed over.

I work at the intersection of **code, creativity, and curiosity**, constantly exploring how ideas can be turned into something real (or at least interesting). Whether it's game development, embedded systems, or clean backend architecture — I enjoy the challenge of building things that work well *and* feel good to use.

## 🚀 What I'm Focused On Right Now

- 🎮 Designing a fast-paced game inspired by *Brotato* and *Vampire Survivors*
- 🎮 Prototyping a slow atmospheric game inspire by *Resident Evil 2* and other horror games like it
- 🌐 Building efficient, reliable backends with PHP (yes, it's alive and well)
- 🧠 Experimenting with AI and automation (to save time or just waste it better)

## 🧰 Tools I Use Often

### Languages & Frameworks
- PHP • C++ • JavaScript • Python • GDScript
- Laravel • Node.js • Godot Engine

### Tools & Platforms
- VS Code • Git • Linux • Figma • ESP-IDF • MySQL

## 🎯 Projects & Experiments

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **BulletHellGame** | A minimalist survival shooter with tight controls and satisfying progression |
| **Unity horror game prototype** | A small trial project where I try to deepen my understanding of unity |
| **One-Off Experiments** | Small, weird, sometimes useful explorations of an idea or technique |

Most of my work lives in private repos or folders with names like `idea_v4_reallyfinal`. What you see here is the polished tip of a much messier iceberg.

- 🧩 I enjoy solving difficult problems and making systems feel elegant and intuitive
- 🎨 Creative coding is my happy place — from pixel art to procedural generation
